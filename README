VoteFair-polls

This code is used to support the polls in the NewHereNow.com web app.  These polls use VoteFair ranking to identify the popularity of the choices that appear on a ballot.

There are several kinds of code here:

* Most of the code in the "poll-specifications" folder specifies specific polls that are hosted at www.NewsHereNow.com.  This kind of code is edited manually and uses an easy-to-understand format.

* The code in the "balloting" folder converts the first kind of code into JSON-format files that are sent from the NewsHereNow.com server to a web browser that is displaying the NewsHereNow.com web app.  This kind of code is written in the Dashrep language and should not need to be edited after this code is working correctly.

* The code in the folders that begin with the word "calc", and the code in the "words-for-results-article" folder, transform saved ballot information into automatically generate a "newspaper" article that summarizes the popularity of the choices.  The generated article is merged into the JSON-format file explained above.  This kind of code is written in the Dashrep language.  The Dashrep code in the "calc" folders should not need to be edited after this code is working.  The Dashrep template code in the "words-for-results-article" folder needs to be edited to handle specific polls.

* The "VoteFairRanking.pm" file in the "calc-VoteFair-ranking-calculation-files" folder is a copy of the library file of the same name that is in the VoteFair-ranking repository within the CPSolver account at GitHub.com.  The "votefair_ranking_do_calcs.pl" file in the same folder is a short Perl script that passes the numbers-only poll data to and from the VoteFairRanking.pm library.

* The "sample_html_segment_ballot_code.txt" file is sample HTML code from a web app that displays the poll ballot.  This code is generated by other software.  The "balloting" code (explained above) uses this HTML code to display the poll ballot within the web app.
