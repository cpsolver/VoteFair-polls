Coming in 2020: Here you will be able to communicate with your neighbors to help determine who deserves to win your district's seat in Congress. Then you, and your neighbors, can use this information to decide whether you can mark your official ballot for your first choice, or whether you need to vote for your second-favorite candidate in order to defeat the candidate you most dislike. *** Concentrating support on a single money-backed candidate is what the biggest campaign contributors do, based on deals made in back-room meetings.  Now voters in your Congressional district can concentrate support on a single reform-minded candidate, based on finding out which reform-minded candidate is actually most popular in your district. *** Everyone in the United States is invited to vote in this poll, regardless of political bias. Keep in mind that the conflict between "political left" and "political right" is a distraction from the bigger conflict between "political up" and "political down." Political up is where most voters are, and political down is where the biggest campaign contributions come from. The goal of both the "political up" and the "political down" is increased economic prosperity.  The people in the political up category want widespead economic prosperity, and want laws that force businesses to behave in ways that are ethical.  In contrast, the people in the political down category want increased economic prosperity for the businesses they own, without concern for the economic prosperity of other businesses, without concern for the economic prosperity of their employees and customers, and without concern for the overall U.S. economy.  #CongressPoll
