<h1>Anti&#45;Vote&#45;Splitting Poll</h1>
<h2>for the</h2>
<h1>2019 Manitoba Provincial Election</h1>
<p class="evry">Everyone in Manitoba &mdash; especially in Winnipeg, Brandon, Steinbach, Portage la Prairie, and Thompson &mdash; is welcome to vote here!</p>
<h2>Why cast a ballot in this poll?</h2>
<p>Here, today, you get to fill out a <b>ranked ballot</b> rather than marking just a single candidate as your &ldquo;favorite.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The extra information &mdash; from you and other voters in your riding &mdash; is used with <b>pairwise counting</b> to correctly identify both the <b>most popular candidate</b> and the <b>best opposition candidate</b>.</p>
<p>When <b>official</b> voting is a few days away, you can return here to learn the <b>best strategy</b> for either helping to elect one of your favorite candidates, or helping to defeat your most&#45;disliked candidate.</p>

<h1>Here are the latest poll results</h1>
<p class="srt">At the top of this list are the ridings in which <span class="emp">the wrong candidate is likely to win</span> because of vote splitting.&nbsp; (Also at the top are the ridings with the most polling votes.)</p>
<p class="prv">If you live in a riding where vote splitting can cause the wrong candidate to win, please cast your official election ballot for one of the two most popular candidates.&nbsp; If instead you cast your official ballot for a third&#45;most&#45;popular or fourth&#45;most&#45;popular candidate, then you are making it easier for your most&#45;disliked candidate to win.</p>
